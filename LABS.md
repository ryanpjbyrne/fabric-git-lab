## Setup

Manual: [Getting Ready for Class](https://githubtraining.github.io/training-manual/#/01_getting_ready_for_class), [Local Git Configs](https://githubtraining.github.io/training-manual/#/05_local_git_configs)

Follow **Getting started** in the [README](README.md): GitHub account, Git, editor, and a test clone. Come back here once `git clone` works.

## Lab 1a: clone and branch

Manual: [Branching with Git](https://githubtraining.github.io/training-manual/#/04_branching_with_git), [Working Locally](https://githubtraining.github.io/training-manual/#/06_working_locally)

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ryanpjbyrne/fabric-git-lab.git`, then `cd fabric-git-lab`.
2. Look around: `git status` and `git log --oneline`.
3. Create your own branch and switch to it: `git switch -c add-notes-<YOURNAME>`.
4. Confirm where you are: `git branch`.

## Lab 1b: edit, commit, push

Manual: [Working Locally](https://githubtraining.github.io/training-manual/#/06_working_locally), [Local History](https://githubtraining.github.io/training-manual/#/10_local_history)

Each person edits a different file, so nobody clashes yet.

1. Create your own file: `docs/lab-notes/<YOURNAME>.md`, with one line on what you want from these two days.
2. Check what changed: `git status`.
3. Stage it: `git add docs/lab-notes/<YOURNAME>.md`.
4. Commit it: `git commit -m "Add lab notes for <YOURNAME>"`.
5. Push your branch: `git push -u origin add-notes-<YOURNAME>`.
6. If the push is rejected for sign-in reasons, see the
   [Authentication Troubleshooting Guide](https://githubtraining.github.io/training-manual/#/app_authentication).

## Lab 2: pull request and review

Manual: [Collaborating on Code](https://githubtraining.github.io/training-manual/#/07_collaborating_on_code), [Merging Pull Requests](https://githubtraining.github.io/training-manual/#/09_merging_pull_requests)

Work in pairs so everyone reviews and is reviewed.

1. On GitHub, open a pull request from `add-notes-<YOURNAME>` into `main`. Write a short description of the change.
2. Review your partner's pull request. On the **Files changed** tab, add a line comment, then finish the review with Comment, Approve or Request changes.
3. Respond to any comments on your own pull request.
4. Agree a merge method with the group (merge commit or squash) and merge once it is approved.
5. Delete the branch on GitHub, then tidy up locally: `git switch main`, `git pull`, `git branch -d add-notes-<YOURNAME>`.

## Demo: protect main and add CODEOWNERS

Manual: [Protected Branches & CODEOWNERS](https://githubtraining.github.io/training-manual/#/17_protected_branches)

Trainer-led. Use your own copy of the repository, not the shared one.

1. In the repository settings, add a branch rule or ruleset for `main` that requires a pull request and one approval.
2. Edit `.github/CODEOWNERS` and replace the placeholder team handle with a real user or team, for example `/fabric/ @your-org/your-team`.
3. Try `git push origin main` and show it being rejected.
4. Open a pull request instead and show the required review.

## Lab 4: create and resolve a merge conflict

Manual: [What is a merge conflict](https://githubtraining.github.io/training-manual/#/12a_what_is_a_merge_conflict), [Resolving merge conflicts](https://githubtraining.github.io/training-manual/#/12b_resolving_merge_conflicts)

Work in pairs: one of you is **A**, the other is **B**. You both change the same line, differently, so Git cannot merge them automatically.

1. Both: update `main` and make your own branch.

   ```shell
   git switch main
   git pull
   git switch -c edit-nb-<YOURNAME>
   ```

2. Both: change the **same line** of `fabric/silver_clean.Notebook/notebook-content.py`, but make a different change each. For example, A strips spaces from postcodes and B trims postcodes before upper-casing. Commit and push your branch.
3. A opens a pull request and merges it first.
4. B opens a pull request. GitHub reports a conflict.
5. B resolves it in the GitHub editor (**Resolve conflicts**) or in VS Code, keeping both intentions. Locally that is `git switch edit-nb-<YOURNAME>`, `git merge main`, edit the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`), then `git add`, `git commit` and `git push`.
6. Commit, push, then merge.

The branches `edit-nb-A`, `edit-nb-B` and `feature/log-row-count` already exist in this repository. They are used for the trainer's demo, so leave them alone.
## Revert a commit

Manual: [Reverting Commits](https://githubtraining.github.io/training-manual/#/15_reverting_commits)

A commit cannot simply be deleted from shared history. Revert creates a new commit that undoes it.

1. Find the commit to undo: `git log --oneline`.
2. Revert it: `git revert <commit-id>`.
3. Push: `git push`.
4. On GitHub, merged pull requests have a **Revert** button that does the same thing through a new pull request.

## Optional: visualise it

[Visualizing Git](https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/) shows branches, merges and reverts as a diagram.

## Connect a Fabric workspace to a Git repository

Not part of the Day 1 labs. This is preparation for Day 2 (Fabric CI/CD), and the steps you will use with your own repository.

> **Do not connect a real workspace to this repository.** It is public, so every item definition Fabric commits becomes public. Use a throwaway workspace with no real data, or use your organisation's private repository.

Manual: [Get started with Git integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-get-started?tabs=github%2Ccommit-to-git), [Git integration admin settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/admin/git-integration-admin-settings)

### Before you start

You need all of these:

- **A Fabric capacity.** A [free trial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/fundamentals/fabric-trial) is enough.
- **Tenant settings turned on** by a tenant, capacity or workspace admin, under **Admin portal > Tenant settings**:
  - Users can create Fabric items
  - Users can synchronize workspace items with their Git repositories
  - Users can synchronize workspace items with GitHub repositories
  - Create workspaces (only if you want to branch out to a new workspace)
- **Workspace Admin role** on the workspace. Only an admin can connect it. Once connected, other members can commit and update according to their permissions.
- **A GitHub personal access token.** Create a fine-grained token at <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new>:
  - Repository access: only the repository you are connecting
  - Repository permissions: **Contents** set to read and write
  - Expiry: as short as is practical
  - If your organisation enforces SSO, authorise the token for it

Keep the token out of notebooks, commits and chat. Treat it like a password.

### Connect the workspace

1. Sign in to Fabric and open the workspace.
2. Go to **Workspace settings > Git integration**.
3. Choose **GitHub**, then **Add account**.
4. Enter a unique display name and paste your token. For a repository on `github.com` the repository URL is optional. For a `ghe.com` (data residency) tenant it is **mandatory**. If you enter a URL you can only connect to that repository.
5. Select **Connect**.
6. Choose the repository, then the **branch**. Pick an existing branch or choose **New branch**. Use a branch dedicated to this workspace, not `main`.
7. Enter a **folder**, for example `fabric`. Leave it blank to use the repository root. You can only connect to one branch and one folder at a time.
8. Select **Connect and sync**.

### The first sync

- If the workspace or the branch is empty, content is copied from the one that has content.
- If both have content, Fabric asks which direction to sync. Choose carefully, because updating a workspace from Git can overwrite changes in the workspace.

### Day to day

- The **Source control** icon shows the number of uncommitted changes.
- **Commit** sends workspace changes to the branch. Write a message that says what and why.
- **Update** brings new commits from the branch into the workspace. Commit your own changes first.
- To keep one change per branch, use **Branch out** to make a feature branch and a connected feature workspace, then raise a pull request on GitHub as in Lab 2.

### If something does not work

| Symptom | Likely cause |
| --- | --- |
| No **Git integration** option, or **GitHub** is missing | A tenant setting above is off, or you are not a workspace admin |
| Connect fails with an authorisation error | Token has the wrong repository, lacks Contents read and write, has expired, or needs SSO authorisation |
| Cannot find the repository | A scoped token only reaches its own repository, or the repository URL is missing on a `ghe.com` tenant |
| Cannot switch or create branches | By default this needs the workspace Admin role |
| An item will not commit | Not every item type supports Git yet. Check the supported items list |
